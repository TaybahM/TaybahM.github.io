                </span>Read on for more information about what I offer, what to expect and how to contact me. If you're a designer and have questions check <a href="faqs.html#designer">Designer FAQS</a>. Can't find the asnwers to your questions? Send me an email after checking out <a href="oops.html" alt="Questions Not to Ask Designers">this</a> page.</p>
                <p>If you would like to support my work, send me an email and I'll get back to you with the next steps.</p>
                <p>Please keep in mind before emailing me, that I <b>do not</b> sell website templates or create websites. I can work with your web designer to provide content for your website and I may assist with the coding process, however I <b>will not</b> provide a website from scratch for your company. I may create brand design and templates for your web designer to follow and use as a reference.</p>

										<h2>Client Faqs</h2>
									</header>
				  <h3>What can I expect when I shoot an email?</h3>
                  <p>If the email is asking me to do something completely out of my expertise, you'll get an image of a confused cat in response. However, if it's an important question, I will provide my best response as soon as possible. (I can send the confused cat too if you'd like at the end)</p>
                  <h3>What are your rates?</h3>
                  <p>My rates depend on the intensity of the project and the time I am given to complete it. If you would like an estimate, you can send me an <a href="mailto:taybahmohammad7@gmail.com">email</a> with what you're looking for.</p>
                  <h3>How long do I have to wait for a response?</h3>
                  <p>If I am not enjoying a Taco Bell burrito while watching an episode of The Office, my email responses will be pretty quick, usually within 24 hours. I update my website constantly and if I am out of town, that will be shown on the site.</p>
                  <h3>Where can I find your work?</h3>
                  <p>Majority of the projects that I have worked on are displayed on the <a href="index.html">homepage</a>. If you would like to see some of the older, more embarassing work that I've done when I first started graphic design, theres a non-refundable fee of $15 to view them.</p>
                  <h3>Can you throw a quick logo together for me?</h3>
                  <p>Unfortunately, I have gotten this question many times in the last few years. I had to learn the hard way that there is no such thing as a quick logo, so no I cannot.</p>
                  <h3>What is the News Wall?</h3>
                  <p>The <a href="faqs.html#news">News Wall</a> is a place where I post the latest design trends or design updates. I usually update them once a week.</p>
                  <h3>We don't have a budget, but will you still make designs for us?</h3>
                  <p>No, unlike designers who will work for free in return for exposure/networking/relationship building, I'm not interested in any of those things.</p>
                  <h3>Will you ever release a full album of rap?</h3>
                  <p>I dont think so, it's best to leave that to the professionals.</p>
                  <h3>Do I get a vector file for my logo once it's been created?</h3>
                  <p>YES, you get SVG (vector), jpeg, png, and whatever else format you wish. My designs can be used to complete stationery and brand marketing â€“ including business card, letterhead, envelopes, brochure design, websites, graphics for web sites, direct mail design, email marketing, mailing labels, presentation folders, and any other designs your business may require.</p>
                  <h3>I run a small business and want an online presence to promote my busiess in a professional manner, what do I need to achieve this?</h3>
                  <p>Not me, I am not selling website hosting at the moment.</p>
                  <h3>What if I do not like the design?</h3>
                  <p>If you do not like the design which I have suggested for you, we can discuss further with a view to ascertaining what type of design you would like to see. I would not like to think that you are not happy with the final website design. My aim is to design something for you specific to your requirements which you are completely happy with.</p>

									<h3>Where did you get your website template?</h3>
                  <p>I got it from <a href="https://html5up.net/" target="_blank">HTML5 UP</a>. This website has fully responsive, free and customizable websites that are built on HTML5 and CSS3. I forked a repository to my github account and turned it into a github page. Then I cloned the <abbr title="repository">repo</abbr> on <abbr title="Visual Studio Code"><a href="https://code.isualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Code</a></abbr> and customized it.</p>
                  <h3>Where can I find design resources, tricks or inspiration?</h3>
                  <p><ul>
                    <li>My <a href="resources.html">resources</a> page.</li>
                    <li>I recommend taking a look at <a href="https://youtube.com/c/breakdesignsco" target="_blank">Will Patterson's</a> youtube channel. His page is filled with great graphic design tips and tricks.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> is a great place to look through for design inspiration, it's one of my favorite sites to take a look at when I'm stuck on a design.</li>
                     </ul></p>
                  <h3>What is your main inspiration/motivation?</h3>
                  <p>Knowing that I can reward myself with burritos after a job well done.</p>
                  <h3></h3>
