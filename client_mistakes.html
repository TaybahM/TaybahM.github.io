                                    <h3>I was born in Virginia and currently live in Dallas, Texas.</h3>
                                    <p>My father taught me a lot about product design and the way mechanics work. He would walk me through logical approaches to difficult obstacles that he faced while working on new projects. He is the reason I felt a connection to design.</p>
									<p>Curiosity also played a big role in bringing me to where I am today. When I don't get how something works, I learn it in depth to understand the mechanics of the structure. I've studied 3-D design in an effort to further advance in my field. I quickly realized that my passion happened to be a combination of Software and Mechanical Engineering. I am currently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and hope to expand my expertise in Software in the process.</p>
									<p>I began pursuing my design interests in early 2017. Because I grew up reading and writing Arabic, I decided to try out Arabic calligraphy. I’ve always had an interest in the flexibility of the Arabic language. Certain styles of writing show simplicity and minimalism while others show complexity and great detail. Soon after taking some classes, I got to work. With a couple sheets of scratch paper and a small stick I started scratching away and creating letter after letter until I had a finished piece. I had been teaching Arabic for some time and created these small pieces to give my students who had done a great job in class. A few weeks later, my older brother showed the designs to his buddy who then became interested in purchasing one from me. That’s where it all began. I went ahead and bought different types of scratch paper and frames to start creating more and more. Many people requested specific designs which I would create on an old vector art program and then use as a reference to draw on the paper. This was my first step into the design world. </p>

									<h2>How did I get into Digital Art?</h2>
									<p>As I would continue using the vector art program to create my pieces, curiosity hit me yet again and I wanted to learn more about digital art. After watching some random vector art videos, memorizing key binds, and reciting the color theory combinations like it was religious text, I opened my vector art software and clicked away. I found out pretty quickly that not only was my laptop incredibly slow, but I had also absolutely no idea what I was doing. It took me a few months to figure out how to use the software and get used to designing. Then it took me a few more to be able to convince my mom to let me buy a new laptop. Once all that was complete, I continued creating designs with different forms of Arabic text around them.</p>

                                    <hr class="major" />

                                    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
									<p>As I learned more about design with Arabic, I decided to explore with print material after being hired to work for a client. This pushed me to create designs for clients who would print them on stationary items. I had a major <a href="fslaam.html" target="_blank">client</a> in Maryland who get custom design requests from her customers which would then get forwarded to me. I would create the designs, she would print them on the items and then ship them out. A few months later, I started experimenting with different Arabic scripts and also taught classes on Arabic composition and writing structure.</p>

									<h2>Visual Identity</h2>
									<p>Around a year after my calligraphy journey, I began to feel fascinated by logos and visual/brand identity however I did not have the skills to be able to start designing on my own. I had a sketchbook where all my designs would go, along with some random calligraphy doodles here and there. Once I had enough skills to design more appealing vector art, I posted ads to create logos for small businesses around the area and got some pretty good offers. I created a logo for the same <a href="fsalaam.html" target="_blank">company</a> that I sold print designs to, to a <a href="jamaad.html" target="_blank">Muslim female basketball player</a> and for a few mosques in DC. These were a few of the first freelance gigs that pushed me into visual/brand identity.</p>
									<p>After exploring logo design, I pushed myself to work harder on product design, marketing and brand identity. I then took social media marketing courses and landed a job at a Coding company based in Ashburn, Virginia. While working there, I taught kids the basics of HTML and JavaScript. I also became the lead designer and social media marketer at that job.</p>

									<h2>Brand Identity</h2>
									<p>My most recent design obsession has been brand design. I have been taking classes to learn brand identity and learn more about color theory.</p>
